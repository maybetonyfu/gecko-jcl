Revision Summary

The claims in the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion sections have been moderated to present a more balanced perspective. The revised version now discusses both the positive and negative aspects of our findings.

References to our user study as a “game” have been removed. We now use more precise terminology such as “gamified user study” or simply “user study.”

A new section, Type Systems in Functional Languages, is added after the Introduction to provide background knowledge and better motivate the design of GeckoGraph.

Added Section Structure overviews to both the Related Work and Discussion sections to improve clarity and reader navigation.

The Related Work section has been expanded to include an additional relevant study: “Just TYPEical: Visualizing Common Function Type Signatures in R.”

The Discussion section has been strengthened with more concrete examples illustrating the potential applications of GeckoGraph.

Figure captions have been shortened throughout the manuscript for conciseness and consistency.

Added a transitional paragraph between the Design Goals and the detailed GeckoGraph Features to improve flow.

The explanation of Type Classes in Section 3.1 (Section 2.1 of the previous version) has been clarified and refined.

Removed a redundant figure (Figure 4 in the previous version) that did not contribute meaningful information to the paper.

Fixed the a number of wrong references to Figure 7 (Figure 8 in the previous version) due to LaTex syntax error.

Various cosmetic edits were made, including improvements to grammar, spelling, LaTeX syntax, and overall logical coherence.
